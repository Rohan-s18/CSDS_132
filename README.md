# CSDS 132 Homework
## Author: Rohan Singh
Charity Work Repository to help out students of CSDS 132 (Intro to Java) at Case Western Reserve University. If you are in CSDS 132, well then, you're in luck because starting from the Spring 2023 semester, I will be coding all of the Intro to Java Projects for funsies :)  

For other classes like **<a href="https://github.com/Rohan-s18/Data-Structures">CSDS 233 (Data Structures)</a>**, **<a href="https://github.com/Rohan-s18/CSDS338_Lab">CSDS 338 (Operating Systems)</a>**, **<a href="https://github.com/Rohan-s18/Artificial_Intelligence">CSDS 391 (Artificial Intelligence)</a>** and **<a href="https://github.com/Rohan-s18/Quantum_Computing">CSDS 386 (Quantum Computing)</a>**, I've written the base source code, but for CSDS 132, I'll literally just post the solutions. Just write down the comments and change some variable names so that you don't lose points ;)  

This repository is organised by semester:  
  - **Spring 2023:** Spring 2023 at CWRU!!!
